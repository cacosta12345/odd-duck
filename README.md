### Reflections and Comments

#### Reading Journal entry

* The lab was not so hard. John's lecture prepped us pretty good on how to go about doing it. Working with grids is a lot easier than working with flex box, so I didn't have to spend so much time messing with it like before. I'm definitely getting more comfortable with my js.

#### Notes

* Grid is better than flexbox
